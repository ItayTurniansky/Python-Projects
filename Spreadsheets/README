1) TKINTER - GUI
2) multiple tabs - one spreadsheet per tab with ability to access data inbetween tabs.
3) cell text design and font choosing.
4) spreadsheet export to csv,json and xlsx.
5) csv file loading data into app
6) mypy


1) multiple tabs- the app can create multiple spreadsheets, one in each tab and the user can access
spreadsheets from different tabs to use in his formulas and functions. this was accomplished by using
a distinct cell ID and recursion functions.

2) cell design the user can choose a cell's font and text color,
this was accomplished by using a few libraries and built in functions

3) TKINTER GUI- this was very hard to build with no former knowledge, but by far my favorite part of
the project :)
